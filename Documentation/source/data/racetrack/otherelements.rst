Other Elements
==============

Traffic Lights
--------------

The traffic lights used on the track resemble real traffic lights with three colors:  
**red, yellow, and green**.

Specifications:

- Height: **24 cm**  
- Light diameter: **4.5 cm**  

There will be **five** traffic lights on the race track:

- One placed at the **starting point**  
- Four placed at the **traffic-light intersection**

Besides displaying their current color, the semaphores also broadcast their state through  
**Wi-Fi UDP messages** (details in the V2X section).

Pedestrian
----------

The race track features **human-like pedestrian dolls**:

- One pedestrian waits at a **designated crosswalk** during the run.  
- Another may cross at a **non-signaled location**, depending on the team’s chosen scenario.

Obstacle Vehicles
-----------------

Obstacle vehicles are cars similar to the one provided to each team, but with **different casings**.

They can appear in two modes:

- **Static** — simulating a broken/stopped vehicle  
- **Dynamic** — moving autonomously around the track  


Highway Separator
-----------------

A series of  
`Separator blocks <https://github.com/ECC-BFMC/Documentation/blob/master/source/3DModels/TrackParts/Separator_block.STL>`_  
will be placed on the **highway section**, along the line separating the two driving directions.

Ramp
----

A  
`ramp <https://github.com/ECC-BFMC/Documentation/blob/master/source/3DModels/TrackParts/ramp.STL>`_  
is placed right before the highway entrance.

It is covered with the same material as the rest of the track.

Tunnel
------

A  
`tunnel <https://github.com/ECC-BFMC/Documentation/blob/master/source/3DModels/TrackParts/Tunnel.STL>`_  
is placed on the **speed curve**.
