Material
========

The track surface is made from rolls **1.6 meters wide**, with the road markings printed on top using white paint.

The material can be found here: https://www.poolsidebycgt.com/north-america/black-slate-2/

Below you can see how the track surface reacts under different lighting angles.  
Note the following:

- The images are raw; no camera parameters were adjusted for light adaptation.
- The photos were taken in conditions close to direct sunlight, which we will attempt to reduce at the competition venue.
